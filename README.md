# Plotly Chart
Module 12 - Plotly

The project was to create a dashboard that visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer.    The user can select from the drop-down box and the graphs will automatically be updated to display the associative data.  Volunteers will be able to identify whether certain species are found in their navel.

## Deliverable One
Using JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js a horizontal bar chart was created to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual's ID is selected.

## Deliverable Two
Using the same selection criteria from deliverable one, a bubble chart is created to display the cultures per sample.

## Deliverable Three
This deliverable displays the weekly washing frequency value and displays it as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart based on the selection from deliverable one.

## Deliverable Four
For this deliverable, the website was updated utilizing bootstrap to be more appealing to the user.    

The following changes were made:
  - A image was added to the jumbotron
  - The jumbotron font was updated
  - The layout of the graphs were updated to add additional spacing.
  - The background color was added to a light grey.
  - The font color of the body font was changed to a dark blue.
